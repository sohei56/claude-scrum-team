description: >
  Independent code review — Scrum Master spawns code-reviewer and
  security-reviewer sub-agents for unbiased, design-driven review.

## Inputs

- state.json → phase: implementation | review
- backlog.json → all Sprint PBIs with implementation complete
- requirements.md + design docs per PBI
- agents/code-reviewer.md, agents/security-reviewer.md

## Outputs

- `.scrum/reviews/<pbi-id>-review.md` (per PBI)
- backlog.json → status: in_progress→review→done
- backlog.json → items[].review_doc_path
- state.json → phase: review
- sprint.json → status: "cross_review"

## Preconditions

- state.json phase: "implementation" or "review"
- backlog.json has PBIs with implementation complete
- requirements.md exists
- App builds + starts (verified during implementation; if uncertain→re-verify)

## Steps

1. state.json → phase: "review", sprint.json → status: "cross_review"
2. All Sprint PBIs status: in_progress→review:
   ```bash
   jq '(.items[] | select(.id == "pbi-001")).status = "review"' .scrum/backlog.json > .scrum/backlog.json.tmp && mv .scrum/backlog.json.tmp .scrum/backlog.json
   ```
3. **Pre-review build verification**: Start app→all tests pass. Fail→`TaskGet` Developer status→terminated? re-spawn (Teammate Liveness Protocol)→then relay fix request. Do NOT review non-building code
4. Collect review inputs per PBI: design_doc_paths, source paths, requirements.md path
5. **Spawn 2 sub-agents per PBI in parallel (Agent tool)**:
   - `codex-code-reviewer` → design doc paths + source paths + requirements.md. Do NOT pass PBI descriptions, dev communications, .scrum/ state
   - `security-reviewer` → source paths + requirements.md
6. Collect results from both
7. **Doc-implementation consistency check**: Compare design docs + user-facing docs vs actual code. Mismatch→send Developer to update docs (not code)
8. **Handle FAIL**: `TaskGet` Developer status→terminated? re-spawn (Teammate Liveness Protocol). Relay findings to Developer→fix→re-spawn failing reviewer(s)→repeat until both PASS
9. Write `.scrum/reviews/<pbi-id>-review.md` (combined code + security review)
10. Both PASS→status: done:
    ```bash
    jq '(.items[] | select(.id == "pbi-001")).status = "done"' .scrum/backlog.json > .scrum/backlog.json.tmp && mv .scrum/backlog.json.tmp .scrum/backlog.json
    ```
11. Set items[].review_doc_path

## Exit Criteria

- App builds + tests pass (verified before review)
- All Sprint PBIs reviewed by code-reviewer + security-reviewer
- Doc-implementation consistency verified
- `.scrum/reviews/<pbi-id>-review.md` exists per PBI
- Passing PBIs: status: "done"
- review_doc_path set
- Unresolvable issues→logged as new PBIs
- state.json phase: "review"
